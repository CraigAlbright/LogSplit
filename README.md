Quick log Split Utility 

Built this because I had to deal with a 2GB log file that was choking all my text editors. This is a very simple utility and probably not robust enough for production. Use at your own risk. I advise caution while using this, and be sure you have a back up of all of your data before using this utility. I have a few ideas to make this a bit better, will see how much time I have to maintain this.
